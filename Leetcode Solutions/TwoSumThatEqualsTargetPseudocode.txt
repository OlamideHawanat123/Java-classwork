1) Write a function that takes in two parameters, an array of integers and an integer
2) The function returns an array
3) Create an empty array with 2 size to store the two indices
4) Loop through the array with the variable "count"
5) Loop through the array again with the variable "counter"
6) Compare element at count with element at counter
7) if any of the elements at the two variable summed together equals the integer argument, collect the index and save into the empty array that was declared
