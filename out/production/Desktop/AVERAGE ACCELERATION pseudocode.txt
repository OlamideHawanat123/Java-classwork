AVERAGE ACCELERATION
PSEUDOCODE
STAGE ONE
1) Read a number in initial velocity
2) Read a number in final velocity
3) Read a number in time
4) Calculate average acceleration by using the gotten variables

STAGE TWO
1) Prompt the user to enter a number in initial velocity
2) Collect the number
3) Store the number as initial velocity
4) Prompt the user to enter a number in final velocity
5) Collect the number
6) Store the number as final velocity
7) Prompt the user to enter time
8) Collect the number
9) Store number as time
10) calculate average acceleration by (final velocity - initial velocity / time)
