In Think Again, Adam Grant discusses the *Dunning-Kruger effect*, a cognitive bias where individuals with limited knowledge or competence in a domain overestimate their own abilities. This phenomenon leads to inflated self-assessments, as those lacking expertise are often unaware of their deficiencies. Grant emphasizes that this overconfidence can hinder personal and professional growth, as it discourages individuals from seeking feedback and learning opportunities. To counteract the Dunning-Kruger effect, he advocates for "confident humility," which involves maintaining self-assurance while remaining open to re-evaluating one's views and acknowledging areas for improvement. By embracing this mindset, individuals can foster continuous learning and make more informed decisions
